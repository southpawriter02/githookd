# Git Hook Manager: Project Roadmap

This document outlines the vision and roadmap for the Git Hook Manager project. This project aims to create a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly tool for managing Git hooks in any development project.

## Vision

Our vision is to simplify the management of Git hooks for teams and individual developers. We want to provide a tool that allows for easy configuration, sharing, and execution of Git hooks, ensuring code quality and adherence to project standards.

## Roadmap Structure

The roadmap is organized into the following categories, each in its own directory:

- **[Core Functionality](./core-functionality/)**: The essential features that form the foundation of the Git Hook Manager.
- **[Advanced Features](./advanced-features/)**: Enhancements that provide more power and flexibility.
- **[User Experience](./user-experience/)**: Features focused on making the tool easy and enjoyable to use.
- **[Integrations](./integrations/)**: How the Git Hook Manager will connect with other tools and services.
- **[Distribution](./distribution/)**: Plans for packaging and distributing the tool.

Each category contains detailed Markdown files for specific features, outlining their intended functionality, requirements, and other relevant details. This structure is designed to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the project's direction.
